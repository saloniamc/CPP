if we do  
char b[] = {1, 2, 3}
then, 
   cout << b;     will print the address of the the array ie first character

but if we do the same for character array like
char c = {a, b, c, d, e}
the cout << c;     will print the contents of the array i.e  a, b, c, d, e

char a[1000];
cin.getline(a, 1000, '$')      //means store it in array a having size to store 1000 characters and 
                               stop when the symbol $ is given as input
